       "xxbos xxmaj do n't waste your time on this dreck . xxmaj as portrayed , the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture . \" xxmaj gothic \" was entertainment at least , this is crap . xxmaj if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other , this may be right up your alley . xxmaj lord xxmaj byron is portrayed as a complete jerk , and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering . xxmaj mary xxmaj shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever , but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect . xxmaj what a waste of time . xxmaj see xxmaj gothic instead . i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter , but did n't catch the title . i was hoping this was it , but no such luck . xxmaj not recommended .,xxbos xxmaj do n't let the somewhat all - star cast in this movie fool you into thinking it 's any good . xxmaj not that it 's all their fault . i believe most of the blame needs to be placed on the awful writing and directing . xxmaj not once during this movie did i feel any empathy for any of the actors and good lord the action was so predictable . xxmaj the title is even unimaginative and pretty meaningless . xxmaj bettany , although great in other roles , has a hard time convincing me he could kill someone . i have a hard time believing xxmaj ford gave a crap about this movie , when he ca n't even convey that he cares about his wife or family . i love the line where he 's trying to find his family and says \" i 'm going to find my dog \" . xxmaj the humor is flat and timing is awkward . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the movie is a full crap and surprisingly xxup dd released it with another film of his xxup deewana xxup xxunk which had better actors like xxmaj anil and xxmaj xxunk least that time ) and that film worked \n",

       "  xxmaj akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days xxmaj he shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man 's xxmaj govinda xxmaj juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show xxmaj kader repeats his act , xxmaj paresh is awful xxmaj satish xxmaj kaushik annoys xxmaj gulshan xxmaj grover has an indefinite role,xxbos xxmaj my first impression would be this is xxmaj beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting xxmaj grendel and dragons intact , making it one thrill ride from start to end . xxmaj written by xxmaj frederic xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj arthur xxmaj xxunk , the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story , with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around , which can either be wastelands , or globes of greenery . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story 's a simple one , which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon 's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy , and the resident knights have all but been annihilated . xxmaj enter the king 's granddaughter xxmaj zoe ( xxmaj marie xxmaj xxunk ) who gathers xxmaj lian - xxmaj chu ( xxmaj vincent xxmaj lindon ) , a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant , and his partner - in - arms xxmaj gwizdo ( xxmaj patrick xxmaj xxunk ) , who balances the partnership with his cunning brain . xxmaj lian - xxmaj chu and xxmaj gwizdo ( together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires ) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement , but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free , hence their career in monster - extermination which does n't exactly pay off . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj that 's basically the whole gist of it , but what makes this film a spectacle , is its xxup cg graphics , which is solidly rich , detailed , and an eye - popping marvel to behold . xxmaj it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action , , and during those fight sequences , there 's nary a boring moment . xxmaj photo - realistic moments of non - existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make - belief , and it 's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three - suns and a kaleidoscope of flying xxunk ( here 's having at you xxmaj george ! ) xxmaj and i could n't get enough of the finale battle as well , though the usual brick - bats will find some fault at the xxunk of the principle characters . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer - animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of xxmaj pixar 's . xxmaj and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of xxmaj zodiac : xxmaj the xxmaj race xxmaj begins and xxmaj legend of the xxmaj sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple , and let your moving artwork do all the talking . xxmaj definitely highly recommended !,xxbos i first read the xxmaj earthsea books by xxmaj ursula xxup k. leguin back when i was probably about 9 or 10 . xxmaj they were wonderful - i could feel my imagination soar and create mental images of the characters , the environment , the storyline ... mainly based on the wonderful writing of xxmaj ms. leguin . xxmaj when i saw that the scifi channel was going to air a miniseries based on the xxmaj earthsea books ( and man did they plug it over and over ... ) , i was instantly enthused about it ! i had to see it ! i marked it on my calendar ! xxmaj no one else was allowed to watch the xxup tv while this was playing on the day it premiered ! \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj when i actually did watch the miniseries on the scifi xxmaj channel , my reaction was of complete disgust - the storyline , while using parts from the actual books , was neither complete nor in order , the characters did n't seem at all like they should be ( even including their descriptions in the books ) , and everything just seemed wrong . xxmaj the acting by xxmaj isabella xxmaj rosselini and xxmaj kristin xxmaj kreuk , and a couple of others , were decent enough , and the sets seemed to be well made , but that 's about the only good things i can say about it . xxmaj probably the only element that matched my mental images that i had formed from reading the books was the xxunk character . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it 's a shame when production companies and television / movie studios are allowed to take some great work of written fiction and butcher it to the point that the original author is embarrassed about it ( see xxmaj slate 12 / 16 / 2004 - http : / / xxunk / xxunk xxrep 4 1 07 for xxmaj ursula xxup k. leguin 's own words about how \" scifi xxmaj channel ruined my books \" ) . xxmaj authors should be allowed to have final say about how scripts adapting their works are developed , instead of having to sit back and watch the monstrosities that are created just because they sold the rights to their works to a studio . xxmaj shame on you , scifi xxmaj channel ... i wonder how badly you 're going to screw up \" xxmaj battlestar xxmaj galactica \" ? xxmaj perhaps they should just stick to playing science - fiction movies and series reruns .\n",
